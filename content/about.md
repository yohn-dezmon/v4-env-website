# What is Bushwick Eco Initiatives?
Bushwick Eco Initiatives is a community organization that works on projects that seek to minimize or reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  

The first project we're working on is to get Bushwick residents access to **Curbside Composting**; a program currently offered to many other NYC neighborhoods but not Bushwick. Composting can reduce the amount of methane in the atmosphere, as food waste creates methane when it is in landfills due to a lack of oxygen. <sup>[1](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/climate-change/composting-avoid-methane-production#:~:text=Decomposing%20organic%20material%20in%20anaerobic,releases%20methane%20into%20the%20atmosphere.&text=However%2C%20the%20aerobic%20process%20of,in%20the%20presence%20of%20oxygen)</sup> When the same food waste is composted, it is provided with oxygen and does not produce methane! The reason this happens is that different microbes can survive in environments either with or without oxygen, and the microbes that survive in landfills produce methane as a by-product of their energy production.

Since methane is a greenhouse gas, this means that by composting, **we can collectively reduce the amount of greenhouse gases going into the environment**.

While this is our first project, we plan on working on other community driven projects
in the future that will also help to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere, one way or another!
